# Tic-Tac-Toe Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the project is to showcase the author's understanding of these technologies and their ability to create a responsive and interactive web application.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/{username}/{repository_name}.git
Once you have the code on your machine, you can open the index.html file in your web browser to play the game.

# Usage
The game is a two-player game, with each player taking turns to place their symbol (X or O) on the board. The player who manages to get three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

The game is designed to be responsive, so it can be played on a variety of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

# Customization
If you want to customize the game, you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to suit your needs. You can change the symbols used, adjust the styling, or add additional features such as a scoring system or an AI opponent.
